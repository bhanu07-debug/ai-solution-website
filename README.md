## 4. Client Meeting Decisions (Summary)

- **User Accounts**: No public user accounts are required. Access is open to all visitors.
- **Admin Access**: The admin panel will be a single-user system with its own credentials.
- **Branding**: The aesthetic will be modern and professional, using a primary color palette of dark blue and white. (Note: The current theme uses a yellow/orange palette, which can be updated to match these new branding guidelines).
- **Contact Form**: All submissions from the contact form will be stored securely in the Firestore database for review in the admin panel. No email forwarding is necessary.
- **Deployment**: A live deployment is optional. A local demonstration or video submission is sufficient for client review.
