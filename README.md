## 3. Technology Stack

This project will be built using a modern, integrated technology stack:

- **Frontend Framework**: **React** with **Next.js** (App Router)
- **Backend & API**: **Next.js Server Actions** and API Routes
- **Database**: **Firebase Firestore** (A scalable NoSQL cloud database)
- **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS** with **ShadCN UI** components
- **Generative AI**: **Genkit** for the AI Chatbot functionality
- **Version Control**: **Git** and **GitHub**

## 4. Deployment Guide: Making Your Website Live

To deploy your website globally and make it accessible to anyone, you will use Firebase App Hosting. Follow these steps in your local development environment's terminal.

### Step 1: Install the Firebase CLI
If you don't have it installed already, you need to install the Firebase Command Line Interface (CLI) globally on your machine.

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

### Step 2: Log in to Firebase
Log in to your Google account that is associated with your Firebase project.

```bash
firebase login
```
This will open a browser window for you to authenticate.

### Step 3: Initialize App Hosting
Navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal. If this is your first time deploying, you may need to associate your local project with your Firebase project.

Run the initialization command:
```bash
firebase init apphosting
```
When prompted, select the Firebase project you've been using (`aisolutions-hub-1urup`). This will confirm the `apphosting.yaml` file and prepare your project for deployment.

### Step 4: Deploy Your Website
Now, you can deploy your application. This command will build your Next.js application for production and upload it to Firebase App Hosting.

```bash
firebase deploy
```

After the deployment is complete, the Firebase CLI will provide you with a URL (e.g., `https://[your-project-id].web.app`). This is the live URL where anyone can visit your website!

## 5. Client Meeting Decisions (Summary)

- **User Accounts**: No public user accounts are required. Access is open to all visitors.
- **Admin Access**: The admin panel will be a single-user system with its own credentials.
- **Branding**: The aesthetic will be modern and professional, using a primary color palette of dark blue and white. (Note: The current theme uses a yellow/orange palette, which can be updated to match these new branding guidelines).
- **Contact Form**: All submissions from the contact form will be stored securely in the Firestore database for review in the admin panel. No email forwarding is necessary.
- **Deployment**: A live deployment is optional. A local demonstration or video submission is sufficient for client review.

## 6. Areas for Skill Development

This project provides an excellent opportunity to strengthen skills in:
- **Component-Based Design**: Building reusable and efficient components in React.
- **Full-Stack Integration**: Connecting frontend forms and actions to a backend database.
- **Security**: Implementing a secure and protected admin dashboard.
- **AI Integration**: Building and managing a conversational AI agent with Genkit.
