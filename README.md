## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the plan for developing the AI Solution website, as per the initial client meeting. The project involves building a professional, multi-functional website with a public-facing interface and a secure, private administration dashboard for content management.

## 2. Core Features

### Public-Facing Website
- **Home Page**: An engaging overview of AI-Solutions with clear calls-to-action.
- **Service Listing**: A showcase of all AI services offered.
- **Project Display**: A portfolio of case studies and projects.
- **Blog Section**: A paginated list of articles with a single post view.
- **Gallery Display**: A dynamic image gallery of AI-related imagery.
- **Event Schedule**: A calendar of upcoming events.
- **Contact Form**: A form for user inquiries.
- **AI Chatbot**: An interactive chatbot to provide information and assist users.

### Administration Dashboard
- A secure, password-protected area accessible only to the administrator.
- **Full CRUD Functionality**: The ability to Create, Read, Update, and Delete content for:
  - Services
  - Projects
  - Articles
  - Gallery Items
  - Events
- **Feedback Management**: A system to review and manage user feedback and testimonials submitted through the site.

## 3. Technology Stack

This project will be built using a modern, integrated technology stack:

- **Frontend Framework**: **React** with **Next.js** (App Router)
- **Backend & API**: **Next.js Server Actions** and API Routes
- **Database**: **Firebase Firestore** (A scalable NoSQL cloud database)
- **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS** with **ShadCN UI** components
- **Generative AI**: **Genkit** for the AI Chatbot functionality
- **Version Control**: **Git** and **GitHub**

## 4. Deployment Options

You can deploy your website globally using either Vercel (recommended for Next.js) or Firebase App Hosting.

### Option 1: Deployment with Vercel (Recommended)

Vercel is the creator of Next.js and provides a seamless deployment experience.

**Step 1: Push Your Project to a Git Repository**
- Make sure your project is on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

**Step 2: Sign Up and Import Project on Vercel**
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up using your Git provider account (e.g., GitHub).
2. From your Vercel dashboard, click **"Add New... > Project"**.
3. Import your project's repository from the list.

**Step 3: Configure and Deploy**
1. Vercel will automatically detect that you are using Next.js and configure the build settings.
2. **Environment Variables**: If you have any secret keys in a `.env` file (like for Firebase or Genkit), you must add them to Vercel's "Environment Variables" section in the project settings.
3. Click **"Deploy"**. Vercel will build and deploy your site. After a few moments, you will get a live URL.

From now on, every time you push a change to your main branch, Vercel will automatically redeploy the site for you.

### Option 2: Deployment with Firebase App Hosting

To deploy your website globally and make it accessible to anyone, you will use Firebase App Hosting. Follow these steps in your local development environment's terminal.

**Step 1: Install the Firebase CLI**
If you don't have it installed already, you need to install the Firebase Command Line Interface (CLI) globally on your machine.

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

**Step 2: Log in to Firebase**
Log in to your Google account that is associated with your Firebase project.

```bash
firebase login
```
This will open a browser window for you to authenticate.

**Step 3: Initialize App Hosting**
Navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal. If this is your first time deploying, you may need to associate your local project with your Firebase project.

Run the initialization command:
```bash
firebase init apphosting
```
When prompted, select the Firebase project you've been using (`aisolutions-hub-1urup`). This will confirm the `apphosting.yaml` file and prepare your project for deployment.

**Step 4: Deploy Your Website**
Now, you can deploy your application. This command will build your Next.js application for production and upload it to Firebase App Hosting.

```bash
firebase deploy
```

After the deployment is complete, the Firebase CLI will provide you with a URL (e.g., `https://[your-project-id].web.app`). This is the live URL where anyone can visit your website!

## 6. Areas for Skill Development
